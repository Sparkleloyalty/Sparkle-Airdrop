# Sparkle-Airdrop

To celebrate our launch we have given community members 30 Sparkle tokens each, please note only community members who followed campaign rules correctly will be able to claim tokens. We've made sure that the people sending eth to the contract is reverted and not accepted however we are not responsible for any lost ETH if accidentally to our airdrop address.

*Please note* this contract can be paused and resumed, but also load/reload tokens for later campaigns.  When tokens run out, the contract will not honor any airdrop awards but can still perform proper functionality, have tokens added and continue using the contract for other giveaways.

### Unclaimed Tokens 

Tokens that are not redeemed within an appropriate time frame will be given to new winners during the following campaigns leaving one of two scenarios. 
 1. All tokens are eventually redeemed by active participants 
 2. All remaining tokens are kept in the contract address until our next airdrop campaign where new participants will be added and most likely redeem the remaining tokens.
